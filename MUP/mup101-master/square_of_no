Algorithm : 
Start the program.
Declare the assembler directives.	
The input is taken as the counter value.
Move the data into accumulator. 
Keep on adding the data based on the counter values.
Keep on incrementing accumulator value.
Perform Decimal Adjust Addition  that keeps on updating flags.
Decrement the counter value until it becomes zero.
Display the output in the register. 
Terminate the program 

Programs :
.model small
.data
.code
start:
	mov bx,04h
	mov ax,00h
	mov cx,bx
l1:
	add ax,bx
	daa
	loop l1
	int 03h
end
