Algorithm : 
Start the program .
Declare the assembler directives.	
Declare the counter value .
Initialize the starting values as 0 and 1. 
Keep on adding the value and store it in accumulator.
Add the next value with the accumulator . 
Perform swapping to add up the previous data along with the next data.
Keep on decrementing the counter value until its 0.
Repeat Step 5 to Step 7 until Step 8 is satisfied.
Display the output in the register. 
Terminate the program
